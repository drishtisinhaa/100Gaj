        "question": "What is EMI and how can I calculate it?",
        "answer": "EMI stands for Equated Monthly Instalment, which is a fixed payment you make to a lender each month for your loan. Our Loan EMI Calculator helps you estimate this amount. You just need to input the loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure. The tool then shows your monthly payment, total interest, and a breakdown of the loan. While it's a great planning tool, we always recommend consulting a financial advisor for final decisions."

        "question": "What factors affect home loan eligibility?",
        "answer": "Several factors influence your home loan eligibility. Lenders typically look at your age, your income and its stability, your credit score, any existing financial commitments like other loans, and the value and location of the property you intend to buy. A strong financial profile generally leads to better loan terms."
